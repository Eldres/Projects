        <p>In my pursuit to obtain a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I have been working on a multitude of projects,
            <br>most of them have been assignments for the classes I need to take in order to get my degree. 
            <br>However, some are projects that I have done on the side, such as a High-Altitude Balloon project that I did with my dad.</p>
