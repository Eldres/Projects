        <p>My name is Josh Nagel. I am currently attending San Francisco State University, as of 2014, and am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science with a minor in Japanese.
            <br> While attending SFSU, I have learned many things, most of which pertain to my degree, such as java programming language, C++, Assembly, and HTML5 including some PHP.
            <br> Along with these different skills, I am also a member of the SFSU chapter of ACM(Association of Computer Machinery), and through this association I have acquired many unique tools to help me succeed in my field, as well as how to get a job.
            <br><br>On a more personal level, my interests outside of school consists of video games, studying Japanese, which involves a good amount of time in Japan Town to practice what I'm learning in school.
            <br><br>Some other hobbies I enjoy partaking in are, Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, and the occasional soccer. 
            <br><br>As a side project, my dad and I sent a few high-altitude balloons into the stratosphere, in an attempt to practice coding as well as a practical application of some physics, and navigational skills.
